# Frontoparietal-tACS-OUD

![Frontoparietal tACS OUD overview](ReadMeImage.jpg)

## Overview
**Frontoparietal-tACS-OUD** is a code and analysis repository for a **randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial** investigating **frontoparietal dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)** in **opioid use disorder (OUD)**. The trial aims to characterize **neural target engagement** — specifically how frontoparietal network modulation alters large-scale brain activity and connectivity — using **pre- and post-stimulation functional MRI (fMRI)** including resting-state and drug cue reactivity paradigms.

This study was **pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03907644)**, titled *“Frontoparietal Synchronization to Modulate Drug Craving in Opioid Use Disorder”*. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Scientific Rationale

Opioid use disorder involves dysregulated executive control and reward network dynamics, contributing to **craving, compulsive drug use, and relapse vulnerability**. tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation modality that uses weak alternating current to modulate neuronal oscillations and network synchrony. Modulating the **frontoparietal executive control network** may influence downstream cortico-subcortical circuits implicated in craving and decision making.  

This trial’s design is grounded in mechanistic hypotheses: *enhanced frontoparietal synchrony may strengthen top-down regulatory control over reward circuits and alter cue reactivity responses measured via fMRI*.
